# TwoDuBEM
TwoDuBEM uses the [Boundary Element Method][bem] to solve two-dimensional partial differential equations that have been formulated as integral equations.

## Examples
Some applications of TwoDuBEM can be found in the [examples] directory.

## Notes
TwoDuBEM is an incomplete work. It contains docstrings, but lacks proper documentation. Unit tests are also missing. Despite that, TwoDuBEM will serve as a base for future projects involving the Boundary Element Method.
